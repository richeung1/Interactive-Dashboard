# Data Visualization with Titanic Dataset

Using Python and Streamlit to create an interactive dashboard.

Following this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb0A9i6d320).

As of 5/26/2022: layout has been built, KPI's and interactive visuals are being created.

Currently only runs on local server, but later on I will deploy it online so anyone can view/interact with the dashboard.
